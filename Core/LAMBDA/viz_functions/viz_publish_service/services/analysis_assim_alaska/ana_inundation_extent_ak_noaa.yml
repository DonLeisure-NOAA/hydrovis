summary: Inundation Extent Analysis - Alaska (EXPERIMENTAL)
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. 
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over the Alaska domain. Shown are reaches with flow 
  at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 43-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis 
  simulation. Updated hourly.
