summary: Short-Range Water Management Forecast
description: "Depicts the source of reservoir forecasts from output of the operational National Water 
  Model (NWM) short-range forecast. Reservoirs can have forecasts obtained from 1 of 4 sources: Level 
  Pool, RFC Forecast, USACE-Persistence, or USGS-Persistence. Reservoirs that have RFC, USACE, or USGS 
  forecasts use those in the NWM when available; otherwise, the NWM will default to using the Level 
  Pool method. Updated hourly."
