summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Water Management
description: Depicts the source of reservoir forecasts from outputs of the operational National Water Model (NWM) (v3.0) medium-range forecast. Reservoirs can have forecasts obtained from 1 of 4 sources: Level Pool, RFC Forecast, USACE-Persistence, or USGS-Persistence. Reservoirs that have RFC, USACE, or USGS forecasts use those in the NWM when available; otherwise, the NWM will default to using the Level Pool method. Updated every 6 hours.
