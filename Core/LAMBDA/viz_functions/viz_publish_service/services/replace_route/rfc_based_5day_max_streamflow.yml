summary: RFC Based 5-Day Maximum Streamflow Forecast
description: 'Depicts maximum forecast streamflow over the next 5 days derived from the official 
  River Forecast Center (RFC) forecast routed downstream through the National Water Model (NWM) 
  stream network. Maximum streamflows are available downstream of RFC forecast points whose forecast 
  reaches action status or greater. Updated hourly.
  
  This experimental map shows approximated flood inundation extent based on modeled river discharge and contains uncertainty. All flood extents
  have been subsetted to the official NOAA public FIM domain which can be found at 
  https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/reference/static_public_fim_domain/MapServer.'
